  "description": "For general questions and support of the API, contact: webservices@paylocity.com\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nPaylocity Web Services API is an externally facing RESTful Internet protocol. The Paylocity API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.\r\nPaylocity supports v1 and v2 versions of its API endpoints. v1, while supported, won't be enhanced with additional functionality. For direct link to v1 documentation, please click [here](https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm). For additional resources regarding v1/v2 differences and conversion path, please contact webservices@paylocity.com.\r\n\r\n##### Setup\r\n\r\nPaylocity will provide the secure client credentials and set up the scope (type of requests and allowed company numbers). You will receive the unique client id, secret, and Paylocity public key for the data encryption. The secret will expire in 365 days. \r\n* Paylocity will send you an e-mail 10 days prior to the expiration date for the current secret. If not renewed, the second e-mail notification will be sent 5 days prior to secret's expiration. Each email will contain the code necessary to renew the client secret. \r\n* You can obtain the new secret by calling API endpoint using your current not yet expired credentials and the code that was sent with the notification email. For details on API endpoint, please see Client Credentials section. \r\n* Both the current secret value and the new secret value will be recognized during the transition period. After the current secret expires, you must use the new secret. \r\n* If you were unable to renew the secret via API endpoint, you can still contact Service and they will email you new secret via secure email.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen validating the request, Paylocity API will honor the defaults and required fields set up for the company default New Hire Template as defined in Web Pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Authorization\r\n\r\nPaylocity Web Services API uses OAuth2.0 Authentication with JSON Message Format.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll requests of the Paylocity Web Services API require a bearer token which can be obtained by authenticating the client with the Paylocity Web Services API via OAuth 2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe client must request a bearer token from the authorization endpoint:\r\n\r\n\r\nauth-server for production: https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token\r\n\r\n\r\nauth-server for testing: https://apisandbox.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token\r\n\r\nPaylocity reserves the right to impose rate limits on the number of calls made to our APIs. Changes to API features/functionality may be made at anytime with or without prior notice.\r\n\r\n##### Authorization Header\r\n\r\nThe request is expected to be in the form of a basic authentication request, with the \"Authorization\" header containing the client-id and client-secret. This means the standard base-64 encoded user:password, prefixed with \"Basic\" as the value for the Authorization header, where user is the client-id and password is the client-secret.\r\n\r\n##### Content-Type Header\r\n\r\nThe \"Content-Type\" header is required to be \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\".\r\n\r\n##### Additional Values\r\n\r\nThe request must post the following form encoded values within the request body:\r\n\r\n    grant_type = client_credentials\r\n    scope = WebLinkAPI\r\n\r\n##### Responses\r\n\r\nSuccess will return HTTP 200 OK with JSON content:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"access_token\": \"xxx\",\r\n      \"expires_in\": 3600,\r\n      \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# Deductions (v1)\r\n\r\nDeductions API provides endpoints to retrieve, add, update and delete deductions for a company's employees.
