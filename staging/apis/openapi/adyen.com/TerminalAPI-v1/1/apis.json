  "description": "The Adyen [Terminal API](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api/) lets you make payments, issue refunds, collect shopper information, and perform other shopper-terminal interactions using a payment terminal supplied by Adyen.\n \n## Authentication and endpoints\nAuthentication and endpoints depend on whether you are using a [cloud or a local](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/) Terminal API integration.\n\n### Cloud\nEach request to the cloud Terminal API must be signed with an API key. [Generate your API Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) in the Customer Area and set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value.\n\nThe cloud Terminal API endpoint you need to use depends on whether your integration will receive transaction results synchronously or asynchronously:\n\n- Synchronous: `https://terminal-api-test.adyen.com/sync`\n- Asynchronous: `https://terminal-api-test.adyen.com/async`\n \nWhen you are ready to go live, you need to generate a new web service user credential and switch to one of the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api/#cloud).\n \n### Local\nIf your integration uses local communications, API requests are made from a POS app directly to a terminal's IP address. To learn how to set up and protect local communications, refer to [Building a local integration](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/local/).\n \n## API structure\nTerminal API communicates with the terminal using JSON messages. All requests and responses have the following structure:\n- `MessageHeader`: identifies the type of transaction, the terminal being used, and unique transaction identifiers.\n - **Request body**: a request or response object, depending on the type of transaction. For example, when you make a payment request this is a `PaymentRequest` object, and when you receive a payment response this is a `PaymentResponse` object.\n\n ### Requests\nEach Terminal API request you make is contained in a `SaletoPOIRequest` object and needs to have the following objects:\n* `MessageHeader`: for each request you need to include this object and specify the [required parameters](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api/#request-message-header).\n * Request body: the name and structure of this object depends on the type of request. You can use this specification to create the structure of the request body. For example, to make a payment you need to include a `PaymentRequest` object and the `MessageHeader` inside the `SaletoPOIRequest` object.\n\n### Responses\nEach terminal API response you receive is contained in a `SaleToPOIResponse` object and includes:\n * `MessageHeader`: this object echoes the values you provided in the request. The only exception is the `MessageType`, which is always **Response**.\n* **Response body**: the values you receive in the response body depend on the type of transaction request you made. For example, when making a `PaymentRequest` you would receive a `PaymentResponse` as the response body.\n\nBelow, you can find the list of available Terminal API requests with the structure of the request/response body parameters:",
