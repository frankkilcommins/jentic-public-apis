  "description": "The Balance Control API lets you transfer funds between merchant accounts that belong to the same legal entity and are under the same company account.\n \n## Authentication\nTo connect to the Balance Control API, you must authenticate your requests with an [API key or basic auth username and password](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-authentication). To learn how you can generate these, see [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials).Here is an example of authenticating a request with an API key:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n ```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate API credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n \n## Versioning\nThe Balance Control API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BalanceControl/v1/balanceTransfer\n```\n",
