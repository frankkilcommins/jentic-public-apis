  "description": "> **The Recurring API is deprecated**. Use the [Checkout API recurring endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/71/post/storedPaymentMethods) instead.The Recurring APIs allow you to manage and remove your tokens or saved payment details. Tokens should be created with validation during a payment request.\n \nFor more information, refer to our [Tokenization documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/tokenization).\n ## Authentication\nYou need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) to authenticate to the API.\n\nIf using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\n\n## Versioning\nRecurring API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v67/disable\n ```\n\n## Going live\n\nTo authenticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v67/disable\n ```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",
