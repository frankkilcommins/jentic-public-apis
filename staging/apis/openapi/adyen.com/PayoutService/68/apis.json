  "description": "> The **Payout API is deprecated** and no longer supports new integrations. Do one of the following:\n>- If you are building a new integration, use the [Transfers API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/transfers/latest/overview) instead.\n > - If you are already using the Payout API, reach out to your Adyen contact to learn how to migrate to the Transfers API.\n>\n> With the Transfers API, you can:\n > - Handle multiple payout use cases with a single API.\n> - Use new payout functionalities, such as instant payouts to bank accounts.\n> - Receive webhooks with more details and defined transfer states.\n>\n> For more information about the payout features of the Transfers API, see our [Payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/payouts/payout-service) documentation.\n\n\nA set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.\n\nFor more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts).\n ## Authentication\nTo use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nIf using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n \n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).\n \nThe following example shows how to authenticate your request with basic authentication when submitting a payout:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\n\n## Versioning\nPayments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout\n ```\n\n## Going live\n\nTo authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout\n ```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",
