  "description": "Check the new [Pricing onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pricing-overview). We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX. It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Pricing and is organized by focusing on the developer's journey.\r\n\r\nPricing is the VTEX module responsible for the SKU's price list. In this module, we have the base price of each SKU, optional fixed prices by trade policy, and rules that can be applied to dynamically generate different final prices according to the purchase context and the trade policy. \r\n\r\nFind more information on how to use this module and its business logic at our [Pricing onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pricing-overview).\r \n\r\n## Rate limits per route\r\nThe rate limits per route revolve around the following values:\r\n\r\n\r\n| Operation | Rate | Burst credits  |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| `GET` | No rate limits | No rate limits |\r\n| `POST` and `PUT` | 2000 per minute<br>33 per second | 500 |\r\n| `DELETE` | 1000 per minute<br>16 per second | 300 |\r\n\r\n### Burst credits\r\nIn case the account exceeds the limit frequency for a Rate Limiter (for instance, when one account makes 34 requests per second in any price insert/update route), we decrease from the Burst Credit count the exceeding (in this example, 1 Credit).\r\n\r\nIn the event of the Burst Credits reaching 0 (zero), the request is blocked with a Status 429 response.\r \n\r\nThe credits fill up over time when the route is not being used, at the same rate as the route's Rate Limiter. In our example, for each second not sending a PUT or POST request, we increase 40 Burst Credits to this Rate Limiter.\r\n\r \n### Response Headers for rate limits\r\nIn the response of any request to the Pricing API, there are headers indicating the current status of the Rate Limiting. This information may be useful to evaluate the ideal frequency to send requests to a route, and when to send a new request in the event of reaching a Rate Limit.\r \n\r\n- `Ratelimit-Limit`: Total Burst Credits offered to a route\r\n- `Ratelimit-Remaining`: How many Burst Credits are still available to use\r\n- `Ratelimit-Reset`: How long (in seconds) it will take for Burst Credits to fill up completely (it will fill up to the *Ratelimit-Limit*)\r\n- `Retry-After`: Indicates how many seconds you will need to wait until the Rate Limiter accepts a new request to this route again. If this header response exists, this means your current request has been rate-limited and has not been processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Integrating with Pricing v2 considering rate limits\r\nWhen developing an integration, consider the requests/route/account limits specified in the [Rate Limits per route](#rate-limits-per-route) section, and avoid surpassing this frequency.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be rate limited, please await the time in seconds specified in `Retry-After` before making another request to the service, and reduce the rate of requests per second that your integration is making.\r\n\r\n## Index\r\n\r\n### Prices and Fixed Prices\r\n- `GET` [Get Price](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n- `DELETE` [Delete Price](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#delete-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n- `PUT` [Create or Update Base Price or Fixed Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#put-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n- `PATCH` [Create or Update Base Price or Fixed Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#patch-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n-`GET` [Get Fixed Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed)\r \n- `POST` [Create or Update Fixed Prices on a price table or trade policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#post-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `GET` [Get Fixed Prices on a price table policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `DELETE` [Delete Fixed Prices on a price table or trade policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#delete-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `GET` [GET Computed Price by price table or trade policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/computed/-priceTableId-)\r \n\r\n\r\n### Pricing Configuration\r\n- `GET` [Get Pricing Configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/config)\r \n- `GET` [Get Pricing v2 Status](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/migration)\r \n\r\n\r\n### Price Tables\r\n- `GET` [Get rules for a price table](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/pipeline/catalog/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `PUT` [Update rules for a price table](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#put-/pricing/pipeline/catalog/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `GET` [Get all price tables and their rules](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/pipeline/catalog)\r \n- `GET` [List price tables](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/tables)\r \n\r\n## Common parameters in the documentation\r\n\r\n| Parameter name | Description |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `{{accountName}}` | Store account name. |\r\n| `{{environment}}` | The environment that will be called. |\r\n| `{{X-VTEX-API-AppKey}}`   | Located in the headers of the requests, user authentication key. |\r\n| `{{X-VTEX-API-AppToken}}` | Located in the headers of the requests, authentication password. |",
