If this is your first time using the API, start with our <a href=\"/api-docs-old/tutorial\">tutorial</a>.\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version, take a look at the changelog section.\n \n### Requests\n\nAll requests must be made using the base URL `https:///drchrono.com`.\n For each endpoint, up to six different kinds of requests may be permitted:\n\n Path | Method | Side Effects | Success Status | Failure Status | Response Content\n ---- | ------ | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------\n `:endpoint` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` | Paginated list of all endpoint resources that the requester can access\n`:endpoint/:id` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` or `404` | Object with requested ID\n`:endpoint` | `POST` | Create object | `201` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Object(s) created\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PUT` | Update entire object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PATCH` | Update only included values of object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n `:endpoint/:id` | `DELETE` | Delete object | `204` | `400` or `403` | Empty\n\n ### Responses\n\nAll responses are in JSON format. Generally input may use the `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, or `form/multipart` content types.\nThe list of objects returned by a `GET` request to `:endpoint` is paginated and has the following format:\n\n     {\n       \"previous\": URL or null,                    // URL of the previous page\n       \"results\": array of objects,                // these results follow the same format as `:endpoint/:id`\n       \"next\": URL or null                         // URL of the next page (same as the requested URL, but with the page query parameter included)\n     }\n\nMost page sizes default to 250, but can be lowered by setting the `page_size` query parameter. The 'api/appointments' endpoint is an exception to this rule as it has a max size of 20.\n\nSome endpoints may return a `302` redirect response. Most libraries handle this\nincorrectly by resending the response with different headers or a different HTTP method.\nYou will need to resend the original request with the right HTTP method and headers\nto the new \"Location\" specified by the `302` response.\n\n### Permissions\n\nAPI access is managed using scopes and permissions. Scopes are granted to an API\nApplication when a user authorizes and permissions are granted by a primary user\nto other users in their Practice Group. The scopes are granted during the OAuth\nprocess, whereas the permissions have to be granted from DrChrono web app. In order\nfor an app to access information on behalf of a DrChrono user, the user must authorize\nthe app for the requested scopes, and the user must have the appropriate permissions set.\nEach endpoint in this documentation will specify which scopes and permissions are\nneeded for access. Scopes are labeled `drchrono_oauth2` in the AUTHORIZATIONS section\nof each endpoint.\n\n### Data Types\n\nThe data types referred to in this documentation, for both requests and responses,\nare listed below:\n\nType | Example | Description\n---- | ------- | -----------\nboolean | `true` | a binary variable, having two possible values of `true` and `false`\ninteger | `123` | represents some range of mathmatical integers\nstring | `HelloWorld` | sequence of characters\nURL | `\"http://example.com/index.html\"` | An absolute URL, including protocol\nobject | `{\"key\": \"value\"}` | A nested object. All values that are type \"object\" will have a clickable dropdown of the object's format\narray | `[1,2]` | A value may have type \"array of :type\"\ndate | `\"2021-02-14\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded date\ndate range | `\"2021-02-17/2021-02-24\"` | A start and end date separated by a slash\nfile | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a standard `multipart/form-data` file\n base64encoded file | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a base64 encoded file within JSON\ntime | `\"12:34:56\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded time\ntimestamp | `\"2021-02-14T13:40:39\"` | AN ISO 8601 encoded timestamp, with no as_system_timezone\ncolor | `\"#ABCDEF\"` or `\"rgb(12, 34, 56)\"` | A CSS color specified in either of these formats\ndecimal | `\"123.45\"` | A numeric value truncated to two decimal places. It may be passed to an endpoint as an integer, float, or string, but will always be returned as a string.\n\n ### Verbose Parameter\n\nFor some endpoints, certain fields will be excluded in the response to a `GET` request\nunless the `verbose` query parameter is passed with the value `true`. These fields\nhave a particularly large performance penalty. Passing `verbose=true` will include\nthese keys in the response, but will reduce the default and maximum page sizes to 50.\n\n### Rate Limits\n\nApplications are subject to an hourly rate limit, which will reset at the top of each hour.\nRequests over this limit will receive a response with code `429`. By default, applications are\nlimited to 500 calls per hour.

Redirect the provider to the authorization page.\n2. The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to\n   your web application.\n3. Your application exchanges the `authorization_code` that came with\n   the redirect for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.\n\n ### Step 1: Redirect to drchrono\n\nThe first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button\nlabeled \"Connect to drchrono\" or \"Login with drchrono\".  This is just a link that\ntakes your user to the following URL:\n\n    https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED&response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID_ENCODED&scope=SCOPES_ENCODED\n \n- `REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).\n- `CLIENT_ID_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.\n- `SCOPES_ENCODED` is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.\n\nThe `scope` parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.\n If omitted, all scopes will be requested.\n\nScopes are of the form `BASE_SCOPE:[read|write]` where `BASE_SCOPE` is any of `user`, `calendar`, `patients`, `patients:summary`, `billing`, `clinical` and `labs`.\nYou should request only the scopes you need.\n For instance, an application which sends \"Happy Birthday!\" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter `\"patients:summary:read\"`,\nwhile one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least\n`\"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write\"`.\n\n### Step 2: Provider authorization\n\nAfter logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen\nwith your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the\n`scope` parameter).\n\nWhen they click the \"Authorize\" button, they will be redirected to your redirect\nURI with a `code` query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be\nused in step 3.  If they click the \"Cancel\" button, they will be redirected to\nyour redirect URI with `error=access_denied` instead.\n \nNote: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform\n step 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end\n user.\n\n### Step 3: Token exchange\n\nThe `code` obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token\nand refresh token.  Here is an example token exchange in Python:\n\n    import datetime, pytz, requests\n\n    if 'error' in get_params:\n        raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])\n\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'code': get_params['code'],\n        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',\n        'redirect_uri': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirect_uri',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Save these in your database associated with the user\n    access_token = data['access_token']\n    refresh_token = data['refresh_token']\n    expires_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])\n \nYou now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.\n When using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the\n user has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.\n\n## Refreshing an access token\n\nAccess tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the `'expires_in'` key in\nthe token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed.  It\nwould be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you\ncan use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access\ntoken.  Replace the `code` parameter with `refresh_token`, change the value\n`grant_type` from `authorization_code` to `refresh_token`, and omit the\n `redirect_uri` parameter.\n\nExample in Python:\n\n    ...\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'refresh_token': get_refresh_token(),\n        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    ...\n\n# Webhooks\n\nIn order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file\n(even if it is in Test Model).\nEach API webhook is associated with one API application, go to\n<a href=\"/api-management/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to set up both API applications and webhooks!\n\n Once you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.\nCreate a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!\n\n## Webhooks setup\n\nAll fields under webhooks section are required.\n\n**Callback URL**\nCallback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.\n\n**Secret token**\nSecret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will\ntalk more about this later.\n\n**Events**\n\nEvents is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.\n \nEvent name | Event description\n---------- | -----------------\n`APPOINTMENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created\n`APPOINTMENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified\n`APPOINTMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is deleted\n`CASH_PAYMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient payment is deleted\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_LOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_UNLOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked\n`LAB_ORDER_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is created\n`LAB_ORDER_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is modified\n`LAB_ORDER_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is created\n`LINE_ITEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is modified\n`LINE_ITEM_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_TRANSACTION_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item transaction is deleted\n`PATIENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created\n`PATIENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is created\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CMODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is modified\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified\n`TASK_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is created\n`TASK_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item\n`TASK_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted\n`VACCINE_ADMINISTERED` | We will deliver a hook any time a vaccine consent form is signed\n\n\n## Webhooks verification\n\nIn order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification\n step before we send any hooks out to you.\n\nVerification can be done by clicking \"Verify webhook\" button in webhooks setup page. After you click\nthe button, we will send a `GET` request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called `msg`.\n\nPlease use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the `msg` value with\n<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104.html\">HMAC algorithm</a>.\nAnd we expect a `200` JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called `secret_token` existing, and its value should be\n equal to the <strong>hashed</strong> `msg`. Otherwise, verification will fail.\n \nHere is an example webhook verification in Python:\n\n    import hashlib, hmac\n\n    def webhook_verify(request):\n        secret_token = hmac.new(WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n        return json_response({\n            'secret_token': secret_token\n        })\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n<b>Note:</b> Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.\n</div>\n\n\n## Webhooks header and body\n\n **Header**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`X-drchrono-event` | Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or `PING`\n`X-drchrono-signature` | Secret token associated with this webhook\n`X-drchrono-delivery` | ID of this delivery\n \n**Body**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`receiver` | This will be an JSON representation of the webhook\n`object` | This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API\n\n## Webhooks ping and deliveries\n\nWebhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as `POST` requests.\n\n**PING**:\n\nYou can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the \"Ping webhook\" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header `X-drchrono-event: PING` would be sent to the callback URL.\n\n**Deliveries**:\n \nYou can check recent deliveries by clicking the \"deliveries\" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking \"redeliver\" button after select a specific delivery.\n\n## Webhooks delivery mechanism\n\nWe will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.\nHowever we only consider the response status code. We will consider any `2xx` responses as successfully delivered.\n Any other responses, like `302` would be considered failing.\nAnd we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,\nsecond receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.\nAfter these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.\n\n\n## Webhooks security\n\nYou may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where <code>secret_token</code> is needed in\nrequest header.\nTry to set the <code>secret_token</code> to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of\n<code>ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'</code>.\nAfter this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.\n\n\n# iframe integration\n \nSome API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data\nnot offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's\n patient information page via iframe.  We have created a simple API to make this\n possible.\n\nTo make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient\npage, you need to update either \"Patient iframe\" or \"Clinical note iframe\" section in API management page,\nto make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),\nwith the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should\nhave. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it\nis functional and secure.\n\n## Register a Doctor\n\niframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient\npage for doctors registered with your application.  To register a doctor with\nyour application, make a `POST` request to the `/api/iframe_integration`\n endpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not\nexpect any payload.\n\nTo disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a `DELETE` request to the\nsame endpoint.\n\n## Populating the iframe\n\nThere are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the\npatient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:\n\n### Patient Chart\n ![Iframe on the patient page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_patient_page.png \"Patient Chart iFrame\")\n\n### Clinical Note\n![Iframe on the clinical note page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_clinical_note.png \"Clincal Note iFrame\")\n\nWhen requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or\nboth of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame\ncontents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various\nquery parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the `src`\nparameter of the IFrame will be:\n\n```\n<iframe_url>?doctor_id=<doctor_id>&patient_id=<patient_id>&practice_id=<practice_id>&iat=<iat>&jwt=<jwt>\n ```\n\nThe `jwt` parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and\ndoes not implement its own login system.  It encapsulates the other parameters\n in a [JSON web token (JWT)](http://jwt.io) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC\n with your `client_secret` as the key.  This verifies that the iframe is being\n loaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user.  In production, you\n should validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the\n[official site](http://jwt.io)), and only use the parameters extracted from the\nJWT.  Using Python and Django, this might look like:\n\n    import jwt\n\n    CLIENT_SECRET = <client_secret>\n    MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS = 60\n\n    def validate_parameters(request):\n        token = request.GET['jwt']\n\n        return jwt.decode(token, CLIENT_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS)\n\nModern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between\nyour application and drchrono's page through the iframe.  Therefore, interaction\nmust happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.\n\n# Versions and deprecation\n\n## Stability Policy\n\nChanges to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing\nendpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n \nThe drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:\n\n * **Active:** This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by\nour API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do\nnot break backwards compatibility.\n\n* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been\nsurpassed by our active API version. An API version remains in this state for one year,\nafter which time it falls to the not supported state. A deprecated API version is passively supported;\nwhile it won't be removed until becoming unsupported, it may not receive new features but will likely\nbe subject to security updates and performance improvements.\n \n* **Unsupported:** An API version in the not supported state may be deactivated at any\ntime. An application using an unsupported API version should migrate to an active API version.\n\n## Version Map\n| Version Name | Previous Name | Start Date | Deprecation Date |\n|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------|\n | v2           | v2015_08      | 08/2015    | TBA              |\n| v3           | v2016_06      | 06/2016    |                  |\n| v4           | N/A           | 09/2018    |                  |\n\nIf you are looking for documentation for an older version\n\n- [V4(Hunt Valley)](/api-docs-old/v4/documentation) (old V4 documentation)\n- [V3(Sunnyvale)](/api-docs-old/v3/documentation)\n- [V2(Mountain View)](/api-docs-old/v2/documentation)\n\n# Changelog\n\nHere's changelog for different versions\n\n- [Current Changelog](https://headwayapp.co/drchrono-changelog)\n - [V4 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v4/changelog)\n- [V3 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v3/changelog)\n\n",

If this is your first time using the API, start with our <a href=\"/api-docs-old/tutorial\">tutorial</a>.\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version, take a look at the changelog section.\n \n### Requests\n\nAll requests must be made using the base URL `https:///drchrono.com`.\n For each endpoint, up to six different kinds of requests may be permitted:\n\n Path | Method | Side Effects | Success Status | Failure Status | Response Content\n ---- | ------ | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------\n `:endpoint` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` | Paginated list of all endpoint resources that the requester can access\n`:endpoint/:id` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` or `404` | Object with requested ID\n`:endpoint` | `POST` | Create object | `201` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Object(s) created\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PUT` | Update entire object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PATCH` | Update only included values of object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n `:endpoint/:id` | `DELETE` | Delete object | `204` | `400` or `403` | Empty\n\n ### Responses\n\nAll responses are in JSON format. Generally input may use the `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, or `form/multipart` content types.\nThe list of objects returned by a `GET` request to `:endpoint` is paginated and has the following format:\n\n     {\n       \"previous\": URL or null,                    // URL of the previous page\n       \"results\": array of objects,                // these results follow the same format as `:endpoint/:id`\n       \"next\": URL or null                         // URL of the next page (same as the requested URL, but with the page query parameter included)\n     }\n\nMost page sizes default to 250, but can be lowered by setting the `page_size` query parameter. The 'api/appointments' endpoint is an exception to this rule as it has a max size of 20.\n\nSome endpoints may return a `302` redirect response. Most libraries handle this\nincorrectly by resending the response with different headers or a different HTTP method.\nYou will need to resend the original request with the right HTTP method and headers\nto the new \"Location\" specified by the `302` response.\n\n### Permissions\n\nAPI access is managed using scopes and permissions. Scopes are granted to an API\nApplication when a user authorizes and permissions are granted by a primary user\nto other users in their Practice Group. The scopes are granted during the OAuth\nprocess, whereas the permissions have to be granted from DrChrono web app. In order\nfor an app to access information on behalf of a DrChrono user, the user must authorize\nthe app for the requested scopes, and the user must have the appropriate permissions set.\nEach endpoint in this documentation will specify which scopes and permissions are\nneeded for access. Scopes are labeled `drchrono_oauth2` in the AUTHORIZATIONS section\nof each endpoint.\n\n### Data Types\n\nThe data types referred to in this documentation, for both requests and responses,\nare listed below:\n\nType | Example | Description\n---- | ------- | -----------\nboolean | `true` | a binary variable, having two possible values of `true` and `false`\ninteger | `123` | represents some range of mathmatical integers\nstring | `HelloWorld` | sequence of characters\nURL | `\"http://example.com/index.html\"` | An absolute URL, including protocol\nobject | `{\"key\": \"value\"}` | A nested object. All values that are type \"object\" will have a clickable dropdown of the object's format\narray | `[1,2]` | A value may have type \"array of :type\"\ndate | `\"2021-02-14\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded date\ndate range | `\"2021-02-17/2021-02-24\"` | A start and end date separated by a slash\nfile | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a standard `multipart/form-data` file\n base64encoded file | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a base64 encoded file within JSON\ntime | `\"12:34:56\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded time\ntimestamp | `\"2021-02-14T13:40:39\"` | AN ISO 8601 encoded timestamp, with no as_system_timezone\ncolor | `\"#ABCDEF\"` or `\"rgb(12, 34, 56)\"` | A CSS color specified in either of these formats\ndecimal | `\"123.45\"` | A numeric value truncated to two decimal places. It may be passed to an endpoint as an integer, float, or string, but will always be returned as a string.\n\n ### Verbose Parameter\n\nFor some endpoints, certain fields will be excluded in the response to a `GET` request\nunless the `verbose` query parameter is passed with the value `true`. These fields\nhave a particularly large performance penalty. Passing `verbose=true` will include\nthese keys in the response, but will reduce the default and maximum page sizes to 50.\n\n### Rate Limits\n\nApplications are subject to an hourly rate limit, which will reset at the top of each hour.\nRequests over this limit will receive a response with code `429`. By default, applications are\nlimited to 500 calls per hour. Contact api@drchrono.com or your account representative\n to request an increased rate limit.\n\n### Endpoint Levels\n\n`Level 1 API Call(s)` and `Level 2 API(s)` are defined in the following table and are based on the listed `Endpoint`; the Endpoint's corresponding `Level` number listed denotes whether that Endpoint constitutes a Level 1 API Call vs. a Level 2 API Call. DrChrono's definition of Level 1 API Calls and Level 2 API Calls as listed in the following table are subject to change at DrChrono's sole discretion.\n\nENDPOINT | Level\n ---------- | -----\n`/api/allergies` | 1\n`/api/appointments` | 1\n`/api/appointment_profiles` | 1\n`/api/appointment_templates` | 1\n`/api/billing_profiles` | 1\n`/api/care_plans` | 1\n`/api/clinical_note_templates` | 1\n`/api/comm_logs` | 1\n`/api/consent_forms` | 1\n`/api/custom_appointment_fields` | 1\n`/api/custom_demographics` | 1\n`/api/custom_vitals` | 1\n`/api/doctors` | 1\n`/api/documents` | 1\n`/api/iframe_integration` | 1\n `/api/implantable_devices` | 1\n`/api/inventory_categories` | 1\n`/api/inventory_vaccines` | 1\n`/api/medications` | 1\n`/api/offices` | 1\n`/api/patients` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/ccda` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/qrda1` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/onpatient_access` | 1\n `/api/patient_communications` | 1\n`/api/patient_flag_types` | 1\n`/api/patient_interventions` | 1\n`/api/patient_physical_exams` | 1\n`/api/patient_risk_assessments` | 1\n `/api/patients_summary` | 1\n`/api/problems` | 1\n`/api/reminder_profiles` | 1\n `/api/telehealth_appointments` | 1\n`/api/users` | 1\n`/api/user_groups` | 1\n `/o/authorize` | 1\n`/o/revoke_token` | 1\n`/o/token` | 1\n`/api/amendments` | 2\n`/api/claim_billing_notes` | 2\n`/api/clinical_notes` | 2\n`/api/clinical_note_field_types` | 2\n`/api/clinical_note_field_values` | 2\n`/api/custom_insurance_plan_names` | 2\n`/api/eligibility_checks` | 2\n`/api/eobs`| 2\n`/api/fee_schedules` | 2\n `/api/insurances` | 2\n`/api/lab_documents` | 2\n`/api/lab_orders` | 2\n`/api/lab_orders_summary` | 2\n`/api/lab_tests` | 2\n`/api/lab_results` | 2\n`/api/line_items` | 2\n`/api/medications/:id/append_to_pharmacy_note` | 2\n`/api/messages` | 2\n`/api/offices/:id/add_exam_room` | 2\n`/api/pateint_lab_results` | 2\n`/api/patient_messages` | 2\n`/api/patient_payments` | 2\n`/api/patient_payment_log` | 2\n`/api/patient_vaccine_records` | 2\n`/api/prescription_messages` | 2\n`/api/procedures` | 2\n`/api/sublabs` | 2\n`/api/tasks` | 2\n`/api/task_categories` | 2\n`/api/task_notes` | 2\n`/api/task_templates` | 2\n`/api/task_statuses` | 2\n`/api/transactions` | 2\n\n## Value-Add Services\n\nThe DrChrono Partner Marketplace (https://partners.drchrono.com/) is our app store\nwhere customers can uncover integrated solutions to support all areas of their\npractice workflows and business needs.

Redirect the provider to the authorization page.\n2. The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to\n   your web application.\n3. Your application exchanges the `authorization_code` that came with\n   the redirect for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.\n\n ### Step 1: Redirect to drchrono\n\nThe first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button\nlabeled \"Connect to drchrono\" or \"Login with drchrono\".  This is just a link that\ntakes your user to the following URL:\n\n    https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED&response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID_ENCODED&scope=SCOPES_ENCODED\n \n- `REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).\n- `CLIENT_ID_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.\n- `SCOPES_ENCODED` is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.\n\nThe `scope` parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.\n If omitted, all scopes will be requested.\n\nScopes are of the form `BASE_SCOPE:[read|write]` where `BASE_SCOPE` is any of `user`, `calendar`, `patients`, `patients:summary`, `billing`, `clinical` and `labs`.\nYou should request only the scopes you need.\n For instance, an application which sends \"Happy Birthday!\" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter `\"patients:summary:read\"`,\nwhile one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least\n`\"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write\"`.\n\n### Step 2: Provider authorization\n\nAfter logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen\nwith your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the\n`scope` parameter).\n\nWhen they click the \"Authorize\" button, they will be redirected to your redirect\nURI with a `code` query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be\nused in step 3.  If they click the \"Cancel\" button, they will be redirected to\nyour redirect URI with `error=access_denied` instead.\n \nNote: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform\n step 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end\n user.\n\n### Step 3: Token exchange\n\nThe `code` obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token\nand refresh token.  Here is an example token exchange in Python:\n\n    import datetime, pytz, requests\n\n    if 'error' in get_params:\n        raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])\n\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'code': get_params['code'],\n        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',\n        'redirect_uri': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirect_uri',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Save these in your database associated with the user\n    access_token = data['access_token']\n    refresh_token = data['refresh_token']\n    expires_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])\n \nYou now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.\n When using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the\n user has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.\n\n## Refreshing an access token\n\nAccess tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the `'expires_in'` key in\nthe token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed.  It\nwould be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you\ncan use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access\ntoken.  Replace the `code` parameter with `refresh_token`, change the value\n`grant_type` from `authorization_code` to `refresh_token`, and omit the\n `redirect_uri` parameter.\n\nExample in Python:\n\n    ...\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'refresh_token': get_refresh_token(),\n        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    ...\n\n# Webhooks\n\nIn order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file\n(even if it is in Test Model).\nEach API webhook is associated with one API application, go to\n<a href=\"/api-management/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to set up both API applications and webhooks!\n\n Once you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.\nCreate a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!\n\n## Webhooks setup\n\nAll fields under webhooks section are required.\n\n**Callback URL**\nCallback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.\n\n**Secret token**\nSecret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will\ntalk more about this later.\n\n**Events**\n\nEvents is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.\n \nEvent name | Event description\n---------- | -----------------\n`APPOINTMENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created\n`APPOINTMENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified\n`APPOINTMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is deleted\n`CASH_PAYMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient payment is deleted\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_LOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_UNLOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked\n`LAB_ORDER_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is created\n`LAB_ORDER_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is modified\n`LAB_ORDER_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is created\n`LINE_ITEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is modified\n`LINE_ITEM_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_TRANSACTION_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item transaction is deleted\n`PATIENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created\n`PATIENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is created\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CMODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is modified\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified\n`TASK_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is created\n`TASK_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item\n`TASK_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted\n`VACCINE_ADMINISTERED` | We will deliver a hook any time a vaccine consent form is signed\n\n\n## Webhooks verification\n\nIn order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification\n step before we send any hooks out to you.\n\nVerification can be done by clicking \"Verify webhook\" button in webhooks setup page. After you click\nthe button, we will send a `GET` request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called `msg`.\n\nPlease use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the `msg` value with\n<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104.html\">HMAC algorithm</a>.\nAnd we expect a `200` JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called `secret_token` existing, and its value should be\n equal to the <strong>hashed</strong> `msg`. Otherwise, verification will fail.\n \nHere is an example webhook verification in Python:\n\n    import hashlib, hmac\n\n    def webhook_verify(request):\n        secret_token = hmac.new(WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n        return json_response({\n            'secret_token': secret_token\n        })\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n<b>Note:</b> Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.\n</div>\n\n\n## Webhooks header and body\n\n **Header**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`X-drchrono-event` | Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or `PING`\n`X-drchrono-signature` | Secret token associated with this webhook\n`X-drchrono-delivery` | ID of this delivery\n \n**Body**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`receiver` | This will be an JSON representation of the webhook\n`object` | This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API\n\n## Webhooks ping and deliveries\n\nWebhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as `POST` requests.\n\n**PING**:\n\nYou can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the \"Ping webhook\" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header `X-drchrono-event: PING` would be sent to the callback URL.\n\n**Deliveries**:\n \nYou can check recent deliveries by clicking the \"deliveries\" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking \"redeliver\" button after select a specific delivery.\n\n## Webhooks delivery mechanism\n\nWe will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.\nHowever we only consider the response status code. We will consider any `2xx` responses as successfully delivered.\n Any other responses, like `302` would be considered failing.\nAnd we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,\nsecond receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.\nAfter these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.\n\n\n## Webhooks security\n\nYou may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where <code>secret_token</code> is needed in\nrequest header.\nTry to set the <code>secret_token</code> to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of\n<code>ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'</code>.\nAfter this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.\n\n\n# iframe integration\n \nSome API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data\nnot offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's\n patient information page via iframe.  We have created a simple API to make this\n possible.\n\nTo make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient\npage, you need to update either \"Patient iframe\" or \"Clinical note iframe\" section in API management page,\nto make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),\nwith the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should\nhave. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it\nis functional and secure.\n\n## Register a Doctor\n\niframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient\npage for doctors registered with your application.  To register a doctor with\nyour application, make a `POST` request to the `/api/iframe_integration`\n endpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not\nexpect any payload.\n\nTo disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a `DELETE` request to the\nsame endpoint.\n\n## Populating the iframe\n\nThere are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the\npatient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:\n\n### Patient Chart\n ![Iframe on the patient page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_patient_page.png \"Patient Chart iFrame\")\n\n### Clinical Note\n![Iframe on the clinical note page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_clinical_note.png \"Clincal Note iFrame\")\n\nWhen requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or\nboth of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame\ncontents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various\nquery parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the `src`\nparameter of the IFrame will be:\n\n```\n<iframe_url>?doctor_id=<doctor_id>&patient_id=<patient_id>&practice_id=<practice_id>&iat=<iat>&jwt=<jwt>\n ```\n\nThe `jwt` parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and\ndoes not implement its own login system.  It encapsulates the other parameters\n in a [JSON web token (JWT)](http://jwt.io) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC\n with your `client_secret` as the key.  This verifies that the iframe is being\n loaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user.  In production, you\n should validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the\n[official site](http://jwt.io)), and only use the parameters extracted from the\nJWT.  Using Python and Django, this might look like:\n\n    import jwt\n\n    CLIENT_SECRET = <client_secret>\n    MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS = 60\n\n    def validate_parameters(request):\n        token = request.GET['jwt']\n\n        return jwt.decode(token, CLIENT_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS)\n\nModern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between\nyour application and drchrono's page through the iframe.  Therefore, interaction\nmust happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.\n\n# Versions and deprecation\n\n## Stability Policy\n\nChanges to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing\nendpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n \nThe drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:\n\n * **Active:** This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by\nour API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do\nnot break backwards compatibility.\n\n* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been\nsurpassed by our active API version. An API version remains in this state for one year,\nafter which time it falls to the not supported state. A deprecated API version is passively supported;\nwhile it won't be removed until becoming unsupported, it may not receive new features but will likely\nbe subject to security updates and performance improvements.\n \n* **Unsupported:** An API version in the not supported state may be deactivated at any\ntime. An application using an unsupported API version should migrate to an active API version.\n\n## Version Map\n| Version Name | Previous Name | Start Date | Deprecation Date |\n|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------|\n | v2           | v2015_08      | 08/2015    | TBA              |\n| v3           | v2016_06      | 06/2016    |                  |\n| v4           | N/A           | 09/2018    |                  |\n\nIf you are looking for documentation for an older version\n\n- [V4(Hunt Valley)](/api-docs-old/v4/documentation) (old V4 documentation)\n- [V3(Sunnyvale)](/api-docs-old/v3/documentation)\n- [V2(Mountain View)](/api-docs-old/v2/documentation)\n\n# Changelog\n\nHere's changelog for different versions\n\n- [Current Changelog](https://headwayapp.co/drchrono-changelog)\n - [V4 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v4/changelog)\n- [V3 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v3/changelog)\n\n",

If this is your first time using the API, start with our <a href=\"/api-docs-old/tutorial\">tutorial</a>.\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version, take a look at the changelog section.\n \n### Requests\n\nAll requests must be made using the base URL `https:///drchrono.com`.\n For each endpoint, up to six different kinds of requests may be permitted:\n\n Path | Method | Side Effects | Success Status | Failure Status | Response Content\n ---- | ------ | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------\n `:endpoint` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` | Paginated list of all endpoint resources that the requester can access\n`:endpoint/:id` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` or `404` | Object with requested ID\n`:endpoint` | `POST` | Create object | `201` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Object(s) created\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PUT` | Update entire object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PATCH` | Update only included values of object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n `:endpoint/:id` | `DELETE` | Delete object | `204` | `400` or `403` | Empty\n\n ### Responses\n\nAll responses are in JSON format. Generally input may use the `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, or `form/multipart` content types.\nThe list of objects returned by a `GET` request to `:endpoint` is paginated and has the following format:\n\n     {\n       \"previous\": URL or null,                    // URL of the previous page\n       \"results\": array of objects,                // these results follow the same format as `:endpoint/:id`\n       \"next\": URL or null                         // URL of the next page (same as the requested URL, but with the page query parameter included)\n     }\n\nMost page sizes default to 250, but can be lowered by setting the `page_size` query parameter. The 'api/appointments' endpoint is an exception to this rule as it has a max size of 20.\n\nSome endpoints may return a `302` redirect response. Most libraries handle this\nincorrectly by resending the response with different headers or a different HTTP method.\nYou will need to resend the original request with the right HTTP method and headers\nto the new \"Location\" specified by the `302` response.\n\n### Permissions\n\nAPI access is managed using scopes and permissions. Scopes are granted to an API\nApplication when a user authorizes and permissions are granted by a primary user\nto other users in their Practice Group. The scopes are granted during the OAuth\nprocess, whereas the permissions have to be granted from DrChrono web app. In order\nfor an app to access information on behalf of a DrChrono user, the user must authorize\nthe app for the requested scopes, and the user must have the appropriate permissions set.\nEach endpoint in this documentation will specify which scopes and permissions are\nneeded for access. Scopes are labeled `drchrono_oauth2` in the AUTHORIZATIONS section\nof each endpoint.\n\n### Data Types\n\nThe data types referred to in this documentation, for both requests and responses,\nare listed below:\n\nType | Example | Description\n---- | ------- | -----------\nboolean | `true` | a binary variable, having two possible values of `true` and `false`\ninteger | `123` | represents some range of mathmatical integers\nstring | `HelloWorld` | sequence of characters\nURL | `\"http://example.com/index.html\"` | An absolute URL, including protocol\nobject | `{\"key\": \"value\"}` | A nested object. All values that are type \"object\" will have a clickable dropdown of the object's format\narray | `[1,2]` | A value may have type \"array of :type\"\ndate | `\"2021-02-14\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded date\ndate range | `\"2021-02-17/2021-02-24\"` | A start and end date separated by a slash\nfile | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a standard `multipart/form-data` file\n base64encoded file | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a base64 encoded file within JSON\ntime | `\"12:34:56\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded time\ntimestamp | `\"2021-02-14T13:40:39\"` | AN ISO 8601 encoded timestamp, with no as_system_timezone\ncolor | `\"#ABCDEF\"` or `\"rgb(12, 34, 56)\"` | A CSS color specified in either of these formats\ndecimal | `\"123.45\"` | A numeric value truncated to two decimal places. It may be passed to an endpoint as an integer, float, or string, but will always be returned as a string.\n\n ### Verbose Parameter\n\nFor some endpoints, certain fields will be excluded in the response to a `GET` request\nunless the `verbose` query parameter is passed with the value `true`. These fields\nhave a particularly large performance penalty. Passing `verbose=true` will include\nthese keys in the response, but will reduce the default and maximum page sizes to 50.\n\n### Rate Limits\n\nApplications are subject to an hourly rate limit, which will reset at the top of each hour.\nRequests over this limit will receive a response with code `429`. By default, applications are\nlimited to 500 calls per hour. Contact api@drchrono.com or your account representative\n to request an increased rate limit.\n\n### Endpoint Levels\n\n`Level 1 API Call(s)` and `Level 2 API(s)` are defined in the following table and are based on the listed `Endpoint`; the Endpoint's corresponding `Level` number listed denotes whether that Endpoint constitutes a Level 1 API Call vs. a Level 2 API Call. DrChrono's definition of Level 1 API Calls and Level 2 API Calls as listed in the following table are subject to change at DrChrono's sole discretion.\n\nENDPOINT | Level\n ---------- | -----\n`/api/allergies` | 1\n`/api/appointments` | 1\n`/api/appointment_profiles` | 1\n`/api/appointment_templates` | 1\n`/api/billing_profiles` | 1\n`/api/care_plans` | 1\n`/api/clinical_note_templates` | 1\n`/api/comm_logs` | 1\n`/api/consent_forms` | 1\n`/api/custom_appointment_fields` | 1\n`/api/custom_demographics` | 1\n`/api/custom_vitals` | 1\n`/api/doctors` | 1\n`/api/documents` | 1\n`/api/iframe_integration` | 1\n `/api/implantable_devices` | 1\n`/api/inventory_categories` | 1\n`/api/inventory_vaccines` | 1\n`/api/medications` | 1\n`/api/offices` | 1\n`/api/patients` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/ccda` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/qrda1` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/onpatient_access` | 1\n `/api/patient_communications` | 1\n`/api/patient_flag_types` | 1\n`/api/patient_interventions` | 1\n`/api/patient_physical_exams` | 1\n`/api/patient_risk_assessments` | 1\n `/api/patients_summary` | 1\n`/api/problems` | 1\n`/api/reminder_profiles` | 1\n `/api/telehealth_appointments` | 1\n`/api/users` | 1\n`/api/user_groups` | 1\n `/o/authorize` | 1\n`/o/revoke_token` | 1\n`/o/token` | 1\n`/api/amendments` | 2\n`/api/claim_billing_notes` | 2\n`/api/clinical_notes` | 2\n`/api/clinical_note_field_types` | 2\n`/api/clinical_note_field_values` | 2\n`/api/custom_insurance_plan_names` | 2\n`/api/eligibility_checks` | 2\n`/api/eobs`| 2\n`/api/fee_schedules` | 2\n `/api/insurances` | 2\n`/api/lab_documents` | 2\n`/api/lab_orders` | 2\n`/api/lab_orders_summary` | 2\n`/api/lab_tests` | 2\n`/api/lab_results` | 2\n`/api/line_items` | 2\n`/api/medications/:id/append_to_pharmacy_note` | 2\n`/api/messages` | 2\n`/api/offices/:id/add_exam_room` | 2\n`/api/pateint_lab_results` | 2\n`/api/patient_messages` | 2\n`/api/patient_payments` | 2\n`/api/patient_payment_log` | 2\n`/api/patient_vaccine_records` | 2\n`/api/prescription_messages` | 2\n`/api/procedures` | 2\n`/api/sublabs` | 2\n`/api/tasks` | 2\n`/api/task_categories` | 2\n`/api/task_notes` | 2\n`/api/task_templates` | 2\n`/api/task_statuses` | 2\n`/api/transactions` | 2\n\n## Value-Add Services\n\nThe DrChrono Partner Marketplace (https://partners.drchrono.com/) is our app store\nwhere customers can uncover integrated solutions to support all areas of their\npractice workflows and business needs.

Redirect the provider to the authorization page.\n2. The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to\n   your web application.\n3. Your application exchanges the `authorization_code` that came with\n   the redirect for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.\n\n ### Step 1: Redirect to drchrono\n\nThe first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button\nlabeled \"Connect to drchrono\" or \"Login with drchrono\".  This is just a link that\ntakes your user to the following URL:\n\n    https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED&response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID_ENCODED&scope=SCOPES_ENCODED\n \n- `REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).\n- `CLIENT_ID_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.\n- `SCOPES_ENCODED` is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.\n\nThe `scope` parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.\n If omitted, all scopes will be requested.\n\nScopes are of the form `BASE_SCOPE:[read|write]` where `BASE_SCOPE` is any of `user`, `calendar`, `patients`, `patients:summary`, `billing`, `clinical` and `labs`.\nYou should request only the scopes you need.\n For instance, an application which sends \"Happy Birthday!\" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter `\"patients:summary:read\"`,\nwhile one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least\n`\"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write\"`.\n\n### Step 2: Provider authorization\n\nAfter logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen\nwith your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the\n`scope` parameter).\n\nWhen they click the \"Authorize\" button, they will be redirected to your redirect\nURI with a `code` query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be\nused in step 3.  If they click the \"Cancel\" button, they will be redirected to\nyour redirect URI with `error=access_denied` instead.\n \nNote: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform\n step 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end\n user.\n\n### Step 3: Token exchange\n\nThe `code` obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token\nand refresh token.  Here is an example token exchange in Python:\n\n    import datetime, pytz, requests\n\n    if 'error' in get_params:\n        raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])\n\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'code': get_params['code'],\n        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',\n        'redirect_uri': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirect_uri',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Save these in your database associated with the user\n    access_token = data['access_token']\n    refresh_token = data['refresh_token']\n    expires_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])\n \nYou now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.\n When using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the\n user has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.\n\n## Refreshing an access token\n\nAccess tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the `'expires_in'` key in\nthe token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed.  It\nwould be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you\ncan use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access\ntoken.  Replace the `code` parameter with `refresh_token`, change the value\n`grant_type` from `authorization_code` to `refresh_token`, and omit the\n `redirect_uri` parameter.\n\nExample in Python:\n\n    ...\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'refresh_token': get_refresh_token(),\n        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    ...\n\n# Webhooks\n\nIn order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file\n(even if it is in Test Model).\nEach API webhook is associated with one API application, go to\n<a href=\"/api-management/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to set up both API applications and webhooks!\n\n Once you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.\nCreate a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!\n\n## Webhooks setup\n\nAll fields under webhooks section are required.\n\n**Callback URL**\nCallback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.\n\n**Secret token**\nSecret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will\ntalk more about this later.\n\n**Events**\n\nEvents is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.\n \nEvent name | Event description\n---------- | -----------------\n`APPOINTMENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created\n`APPOINTMENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified\n`APPOINTMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is deleted\n`CASH_PAYMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient payment is deleted\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_LOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_UNLOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked\n`LAB_ORDER_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is created\n`LAB_ORDER_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is modified\n`LAB_ORDER_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is created\n`LINE_ITEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is modified\n`LINE_ITEM_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_TRANSACTION_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item transaction is deleted\n`PATIENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created\n`PATIENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is created\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CMODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is modified\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified\n`TASK_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is created\n`TASK_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item\n`TASK_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted\n`VACCINE_ADMINISTERED` | We will deliver a hook any time a vaccine consent form is signed\n\n\n## Webhooks verification\n\nIn order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification\n step before we send any hooks out to you.\n\nVerification can be done by clicking \"Verify webhook\" button in webhooks setup page. After you click\nthe button, we will send a `GET` request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called `msg`.\n\nPlease use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the `msg` value with\n<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104.html\">HMAC algorithm</a>.\nAnd we expect a `200` JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called `secret_token` existing, and its value should be\n equal to the <strong>hashed</strong> `msg`. Otherwise, verification will fail.\n \nHere is an example webhook verification in Python:\n\n    import hashlib, hmac\n\n    def webhook_verify(request):\n        secret_token = hmac.new(WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n        return json_response({\n            'secret_token': secret_token\n        })\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n<b>Note:</b> Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.\n</div>\n\n\n## Webhooks header and body\n\n **Header**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`X-drchrono-event` | Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or `PING`\n`X-drchrono-signature` | Secret token associated with this webhook\n`X-drchrono-delivery` | ID of this delivery\n \n**Body**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`receiver` | This will be an JSON representation of the webhook\n`object` | This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API\n\n## Webhooks ping and deliveries\n\nWebhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as `POST` requests.\n\n**PING**:\n\nYou can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the \"Ping webhook\" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header `X-drchrono-event: PING` would be sent to the callback URL.\n\n**Deliveries**:\n \nYou can check recent deliveries by clicking the \"deliveries\" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking \"redeliver\" button after select a specific delivery.\n\n## Webhooks delivery mechanism\n\nWe will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.\nHowever we only consider the response status code. We will consider any `2xx` responses as successfully delivered.\n Any other responses, like `302` would be considered failing.\nAnd we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,\nsecond receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.\nAfter these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.\n\n\n## Webhooks security\n\nYou may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where <code>secret_token</code> is needed in\nrequest header.\nTry to set the <code>secret_token</code> to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of\n<code>ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'</code>.\nAfter this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.\n\n\n# iframe integration\n \nSome API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data\nnot offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's\n patient information page via iframe.  We have created a simple API to make this\n possible.\n\nTo make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient\npage, you need to update either \"Patient iframe\" or \"Clinical note iframe\" section in API management page,\nto make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),\nwith the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should\nhave. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it\nis functional and secure.\n\n## Register a Doctor\n\niframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient\npage for doctors registered with your application.  To register a doctor with\nyour application, make a `POST` request to the `/api/iframe_integration`\n endpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not\nexpect any payload.\n\nTo disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a `DELETE` request to the\nsame endpoint.\n\n## Populating the iframe\n\nThere are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the\npatient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:\n\n### Patient Chart\n ![Iframe on the patient page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_patient_page.png \"Patient Chart iFrame\")\n\n### Clinical Note\n![Iframe on the clinical note page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_clinical_note.png \"Clincal Note iFrame\")\n\nWhen requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or\nboth of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame\ncontents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various\nquery parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the `src`\nparameter of the IFrame will be:\n\n```\n<iframe_url>?doctor_id=<doctor_id>&patient_id=<patient_id>&practice_id=<practice_id>&iat=<iat>&jwt=<jwt>\n ```\n\nThe `jwt` parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and\ndoes not implement its own login system.  It encapsulates the other parameters\n in a [JSON web token (JWT)](http://jwt.io) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC\n with your `client_secret` as the key.  This verifies that the iframe is being\n loaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user.  In production, you\n should validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the\n[official site](http://jwt.io)), and only use the parameters extracted from the\nJWT.  Using Python and Django, this might look like:\n\n    import jwt\n\n    CLIENT_SECRET = <client_secret>\n    MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS = 60\n\n    def validate_parameters(request):\n        token = request.GET['jwt']\n\n        return jwt.decode(token, CLIENT_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS)\n\nModern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between\nyour application and drchrono's page through the iframe.  Therefore, interaction\nmust happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.\n\n# Versions and deprecation\n\n## Stability Policy\n\nChanges to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing\nendpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n \nThe drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:\n\n * **Active:** This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by\nour API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do\nnot break backwards compatibility.\n\n* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been\nsurpassed by our active API version. An API version remains in this state for one year,\nafter which time it falls to the not supported state. A deprecated API version is passively supported;\nwhile it won't be removed until becoming unsupported, it may not receive new features but will likely\nbe subject to security updates and performance improvements.\n \n* **Unsupported:** An API version in the not supported state may be deactivated at any\ntime. An application using an unsupported API version should migrate to an active API version.\n\n## Version Map\n| Version Name | Previous Name | Start Date | Deprecation Date |\n|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------|\n | v2           | v2015_08      | 08/2015    | TBA              |\n| v3           | v2016_06      | 06/2016    |                  |\n| v4           | N/A           | 09/2018    |                  |\n\nIf you are looking for documentation for an older version\n\n- [V4(Hunt Valley)](/api-docs-old/v4/documentation) (old V4 documentation)\n- [V3(Sunnyvale)](/api-docs-old/v3/documentation)\n- [V2(Mountain View)](/api-docs-old/v2/documentation)\n\n# Changelog\n\nHere's changelog for different versions\n\n- [Current Changelog](https://headwayapp.co/drchrono-changelog)\n - [V4 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v4/changelog)\n- [V3 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v3/changelog)\n\n",

THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN SECTION 7 AND 8 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\n\n\n9.  **Confidentiality**\n \nDuring the Term, DrChrono may provide Development User with confidential and/or proprietary materials and information (\"**Confidential Information**\"). All materials and information provided by DrChrono to Development User and identified at the time of disclosure as \"Confidential\" or bearing a similar legend, and all other information that Development User reasonably should have known was the confidential information of DrChrono given the nature of the data and/or the circumstances surrounding disclosure, shall be considered Confidential Information hereunder; for the avoidance of doubt, all information provided by DrChrono in connection with the Services and Development Software is Confidential Information, including without limitation any credentials used to access the API, all documentation, and these Terms. Development User shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and shall not disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of drchrono. Development User shall only use the Confidential Information internally for the purpose of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under these Terms. The obligations in this Section 9 shall not apply to any information that is generally available to the public prior to disclosure. Development User may disclose Confidential Information as required by law or court order; provided that, Development User provides DrChrono with prompt written notice thereof and uses its best efforts to limit disclosure. At any time, upon drchrono's request, Development User shall return to DrChrono all Confidential Information in its possession, including, without limitation, all copies and extracts thereof.\n\n\n\n10.  **Notices**\n\nAny notice or communication from one party to the other shall be in writing and either personally delivered or sent via confirmed facsimile, recognized express delivery courier or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to such other party at the address provided by Development User during the sign-up process (in the case of notice to Development User) and 328 Gibraltar Dr, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 (in the case of notice to drchrono); provided, however, that DrChrono may also provide notice to Development User by email at the email address provided by Development User during the sign-up process. All notices shall be in English and effective upon receipt.\n\n\n\n11.  **Miscellaneous**\n\n    1.  <u>Authority</u>. Development User represents and warrants to DrChrono that (i) Development User has the right and authority to enter into these Terms, to grant all rights herein granted and to fully perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) Development User's performance of its obligations under these Terms will not violate the terms of any other agreement to which Development User is a party.\n    2.  <u>Modifications</u>.

If this is your first time using the API, start with our <a href=\"/api-docs-old/tutorial\">tutorial</a>.\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version, take a look at the changelog section.\n \n### Requests\n\nAll requests must be made using the base URL `https:///drchrono.com`.\n For each endpoint, up to six different kinds of requests may be permitted:\n\n Path | Method | Side Effects | Success Status | Failure Status | Response Content\n ---- | ------ | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------\n `:endpoint` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` | Paginated list of all endpoint resources that the requester can access\n`:endpoint/:id` | `GET` | None | `200` | `403` or `404` | Object with requested ID\n`:endpoint` | `POST` | Create object | `201` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Object(s) created\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PUT` | Update entire object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n`:endpoint/:id` | `PATCH` | Update only included values of object | `204` | `400`, `403`, or `409` | Empty\n `:endpoint/:id` | `DELETE` | Delete object | `204` | `400` or `403` | Empty\n\n ### Responses\n\nAll responses are in JSON format. Generally input may use the `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, or `form/multipart` content types.\nThe list of objects returned by a `GET` request to `:endpoint` is paginated and has the following format:\n\n     {\n       \"previous\": URL or null,                    // URL of the previous page\n       \"results\": array of objects,                // these results follow the same format as `:endpoint/:id`\n       \"next\": URL or null                         // URL of the next page (same as the requested URL, but with the page query parameter included)\n     }\n\nMost page sizes default to 250, but can be lowered by setting the `page_size` query parameter. The 'api/appointments' endpoint is an exception to this rule as it has a max size of 20.\n\nSome endpoints may return a `302` redirect response. Most libraries handle this\nincorrectly by resending the response with different headers or a different HTTP method.\nYou will need to resend the original request with the right HTTP method and headers\nto the new \"Location\" specified by the `302` response.\n\n### Permissions\n\nAPI access is managed using scopes and permissions. Scopes are granted to an API\nApplication when a user authorizes and permissions are granted by a primary user\nto other users in their Practice Group. The scopes are granted during the OAuth\nprocess, whereas the permissions have to be granted from DrChrono web app. In order\nfor an app to access information on behalf of a DrChrono user, the user must authorize\nthe app for the requested scopes, and the user must have the appropriate permissions set.\nEach endpoint in this documentation will specify which scopes and permissions are\nneeded for access. Scopes are labeled `drchrono_oauth2` in the AUTHORIZATIONS section\nof each endpoint.\n\n### Data Types\n\nThe data types referred to in this documentation, for both requests and responses,\nare listed below:\n\nType | Example | Description\n---- | ------- | -----------\nboolean | `true` | a binary variable, having two possible values of `true` and `false`\ninteger | `123` | represents some range of mathmatical integers\nstring | `HelloWorld` | sequence of characters\nURL | `\"http://example.com/index.html\"` | An absolute URL, including protocol\nobject | `{\"key\": \"value\"}` | A nested object. All values that are type \"object\" will have a clickable dropdown of the object's format\narray | `[1,2]` | A value may have type \"array of :type\"\ndate | `\"2021-02-14\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded date\ndate range | `\"2021-02-17/2021-02-24\"` | A start and end date separated by a slash\nfile | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a standard `multipart/form-data` file\n base64encoded file | `\"https://rackcdn.com/file.ext\"` | When uploading, this is provided as a base64 encoded file within JSON\ntime | `\"12:34:56\"` | An ISO 8601 encoded time\ntimestamp | `\"2021-02-14T13:40:39\"` | AN ISO 8601 encoded timestamp, with no as_system_timezone\ncolor | `\"#ABCDEF\"` or `\"rgb(12, 34, 56)\"` | A CSS color specified in either of these formats\ndecimal | `\"123.45\"` | A numeric value truncated to two decimal places. It may be passed to an endpoint as an integer, float, or string, but will always be returned as a string.\n\n ### Verbose Parameter\n\nFor some endpoints, certain fields will be excluded in the response to a `GET` request\nunless the `verbose` query parameter is passed with the value `true`. These fields\nhave a particularly large performance penalty. Passing `verbose=true` will include\nthese keys in the response, but will reduce the default and maximum page sizes to 50.\n\n### Rate Limits\n\nApplications are subject to an hourly rate limit, which will reset at the top of each hour.\nRequests over this limit will receive a response with code `429`. By default, applications are\nlimited to 500 calls per hour. Contact api@drchrono.com or your account representative\n to request an increased rate limit.\n\n### Endpoint Levels\n\n`Level 1 API Call(s)` and `Level 2 API(s)` are defined in the following table and are based on the listed `Endpoint`; the Endpoint's corresponding `Level` number listed denotes whether that Endpoint constitutes a Level 1 API Call vs. a Level 2 API Call. DrChrono's definition of Level 1 API Calls and Level 2 API Calls as listed in the following table are subject to change at DrChrono's sole discretion.\n\nENDPOINT | Level\n ---------- | -----\n`/api/allergies` | 1\n`/api/appointments` | 1\n`/api/appointment_profiles` | 1\n`/api/appointment_templates` | 1\n`/api/billing_profiles` | 1\n`/api/care_plans` | 1\n`/api/clinical_note_templates` | 1\n`/api/comm_logs` | 1\n`/api/consent_forms` | 1\n`/api/custom_appointment_fields` | 1\n`/api/custom_demographics` | 1\n`/api/custom_vitals` | 1\n`/api/doctors` | 1\n`/api/documents` | 1\n`/api/iframe_integration` | 1\n `/api/implantable_devices` | 1\n`/api/inventory_categories` | 1\n`/api/inventory_vaccines` | 1\n`/api/medications` | 1\n`/api/offices` | 1\n`/api/patients` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/ccda` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/qrda1` | 1\n`/api/patients/:id/onpatient_access` | 1\n `/api/patient_communications` | 1\n`/api/patient_flag_types` | 1\n`/api/patient_interventions` | 1\n`/api/patient_physical_exams` | 1\n`/api/patient_risk_assessments` | 1\n `/api/patients_summary` | 1\n`/api/problems` | 1\n`/api/reminder_profiles` | 1\n `/api/telehealth_appointments` | 1\n`/api/users` | 1\n`/api/user_groups` | 1\n `/o/authorize` | 1\n`/o/revoke_token` | 1\n`/o/token` | 1\n`/api/amendments` | 2\n`/api/claim_billing_notes` | 2\n`/api/clinical_notes` | 2\n`/api/clinical_note_field_types` | 2\n`/api/clinical_note_field_values` | 2\n`/api/custom_insurance_plan_names` | 2\n`/api/eligibility_checks` | 2\n`/api/eobs`| 2\n`/api/fee_schedules` | 2\n `/api/insurances` | 2\n`/api/lab_documents` | 2\n`/api/lab_orders` | 2\n`/api/lab_orders_summary` | 2\n`/api/lab_tests` | 2\n`/api/lab_results` | 2\n`/api/line_items` | 2\n`/api/medications/:id/append_to_pharmacy_note` | 2\n`/api/messages` | 2\n`/api/offices/:id/add_exam_room` | 2\n`/api/pateint_lab_results` | 2\n`/api/patient_messages` | 2\n`/api/patient_payments` | 2\n`/api/patient_payment_log` | 2\n`/api/patient_vaccine_records` | 2\n`/api/prescription_messages` | 2\n`/api/procedures` | 2\n`/api/sublabs` | 2\n`/api/tasks` | 2\n`/api/task_categories` | 2\n`/api/task_notes` | 2\n`/api/task_templates` | 2\n`/api/task_statuses` | 2\n`/api/transactions` | 2\n\n## Value-Add Services\n\nThe DrChrono Partner Marketplace (https://partners.drchrono.com/) is our app store\nwhere customers can uncover integrated solutions to support all areas of their\npractice workflows and business needs.

Redirect the provider to the authorization page.\n2. The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to\n   your web application.\n3. Your application exchanges the `authorization_code` that came with\n   the redirect for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.\n\n ### Step 1: Redirect to drchrono\n\nThe first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button\nlabeled \"Connect to drchrono\" or \"Login with drchrono\".  This is just a link that\ntakes your user to the following URL:\n\n    https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED&response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID_ENCODED&scope=SCOPES_ENCODED\n \n- `REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).\n- `CLIENT_ID_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.\n- `SCOPES_ENCODED` is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.\n\nThe `scope` parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.\n If omitted, all scopes will be requested.\n\nScopes are of the form `BASE_SCOPE:[read|write]` where `BASE_SCOPE` is any of `user`, `calendar`, `patients`, `patients:summary`, `billing`, `clinical` and `labs`.\nYou should request only the scopes you need.\n For instance, an application which sends \"Happy Birthday!\" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter `\"patients:summary:read\"`,\nwhile one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least\n`\"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write\"`.\n\n### Step 2: Provider authorization\n\nAfter logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen\nwith your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the\n`scope` parameter).\n\nWhen they click the \"Authorize\" button, they will be redirected to your redirect\nURI with a `code` query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be\nused in step 3.  If they click the \"Cancel\" button, they will be redirected to\nyour redirect URI with `error=access_denied` instead.\n \nNote: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform\n step 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end\n user.\n\n### Step 3: Token exchange\n\nThe `code` obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token\nand refresh token.  Here is an example token exchange in Python:\n\n    import datetime, pytz, requests\n\n    if 'error' in get_params:\n        raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])\n\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'code': get_params['code'],\n        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',\n        'redirect_uri': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirect_uri',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Save these in your database associated with the user\n    access_token = data['access_token']\n    refresh_token = data['refresh_token']\n    expires_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])\n \nYou now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.\n When using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the\n user has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.\n\n## Refreshing an access token\n\nAccess tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the `'expires_in'` key in\nthe token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed.  It\nwould be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you\ncan use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access\ntoken.  Replace the `code` parameter with `refresh_token`, change the value\n`grant_type` from `authorization_code` to `refresh_token`, and omit the\n `redirect_uri` parameter.\n\nExample in Python:\n\n    ...\n    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={\n        'refresh_token': get_refresh_token(),\n        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',\n        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',\n        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',\n    })\n    ...\n\n# Webhooks\n\nIn order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file\n(even if it is in Test Model).\nEach API webhook is associated with one API application, go to\n<a href=\"/api-management/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to set up both API applications and webhooks!\n\n Once you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.\nCreate a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!\n\n## Webhooks setup\n\nAll fields under webhooks section are required.\n\n**Callback URL**\nCallback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.\n\n**Secret token**\nSecret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will\ntalk more about this later.\n\n**Events**\n\nEvents is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.\n \nEvent name | Event description\n---------- | -----------------\n`APPOINTMENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created\n`APPOINTMENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified\n`APPOINTMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is deleted\n`CASH_PAYMENT_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient payment is deleted\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_LOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked\n`CLINICAL_NOTE_UNLOCK` | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked\n`LAB_ORDER_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is created\n`LAB_ORDER_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is modified\n`LAB_ORDER_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a lab order is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is created\n`LINE_ITEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is modified\n`LINE_ITEM_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item is deleted\n`LINE_ITEM_TRANSACTION_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a line item transaction is deleted\n`PATIENT_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created\n`PATIENT_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created\n`PATIENT_ALLERGY_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is created\n`PATIENT_FLAG_CMODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient flag is modified\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created\n`PATIENT_PROBLEM_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created\n`PATIENT_MEDICATION_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified\n`TASK_CREATE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is created\n`TASK_MODIFY` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item\n`TASK_DELETE` | We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted\n`VACCINE_ADMINISTERED` | We will deliver a hook any time a vaccine consent form is signed\n\n\n## Webhooks verification\n\nIn order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification\n step before we send any hooks out to you.\n\nVerification can be done by clicking \"Verify webhook\" button in webhooks setup page. After you click\nthe button, we will send a `GET` request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called `msg`.\n\nPlease use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the `msg` value with\n<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104.html\">HMAC algorithm</a>.\nAnd we expect a `200` JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called `secret_token` existing, and its value should be\n equal to the <strong>hashed</strong> `msg`. Otherwise, verification will fail.\n \nHere is an example webhook verification in Python:\n\n    import hashlib, hmac\n\n    def webhook_verify(request):\n        secret_token = hmac.new(WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n        return json_response({\n            'secret_token': secret_token\n        })\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n<b>Note:</b> Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.\n</div>\n\n\n## Webhooks header and body\n\n **Header**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`X-drchrono-event` | Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or `PING`\n`X-drchrono-signature` | Secret token associated with this webhook\n`X-drchrono-delivery` | ID of this delivery\n \n**Body**\n\nKey | Value\n--- | -----\n`receiver` | This will be an JSON representation of the webhook\n`object` | This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API\n\n## Webhooks ping and deliveries\n\nWebhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as `POST` requests.\n\n**PING**:\n\nYou can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the \"Ping webhook\" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header `X-drchrono-event: PING` would be sent to the callback URL.\n\n**Deliveries**:\n \nYou can check recent deliveries by clicking the \"deliveries\" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking \"redeliver\" button after select a specific delivery.\n\n## Webhooks delivery mechanism\n\nWe will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.\nHowever we only consider the response status code. We will consider any `2xx` responses as successfully delivered.\n Any other responses, like `302` would be considered failing.\nAnd we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,\nsecond receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.\nAfter these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.\n\n\n## Webhooks security\n\nYou may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where <code>secret_token</code> is needed in\nrequest header.\nTry to set the <code>secret_token</code> to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of\n<code>ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'</code>.\nAfter this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.\n\n\n# iframe integration\n \nSome API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data\nnot offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's\n patient information page via iframe.  We have created a simple API to make this\n possible.\n\nTo make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient\npage, you need to update either \"Patient iframe\" or \"Clinical note iframe\" section in API management page,\nto make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),\nwith the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should\nhave. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it\nis functional and secure.\n\n## Register a Doctor\n\niframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient\npage for doctors registered with your application.  To register a doctor with\nyour application, make a `POST` request to the `/api/iframe_integration`\n endpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not\nexpect any payload.\n\nTo disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a `DELETE` request to the\nsame endpoint.\n\n## Populating the iframe\n\nThere are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the\npatient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:\n\n### Patient Chart\n ![Iframe on the patient page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_patient_page.png \"Patient Chart iFrame\")\n\n### Clinical Note\n![Iframe on the clinical note page](https://app.drchrono.com/site_media/cb-af088f58/public/images/iframe_clinical_note.png \"Clincal Note iFrame\")\n\nWhen requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or\nboth of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame\ncontents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various\nquery parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the `src`\nparameter of the IFrame will be:\n\n```\n<iframe_url>?doctor_id=<doctor_id>&patient_id=<patient_id>&practice_id=<practice_id>&iat=<iat>&jwt=<jwt>\n ```\n\nThe `jwt` parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and\ndoes not implement its own login system.  It encapsulates the other parameters\n in a [JSON web token (JWT)](http://jwt.io) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC\n with your `client_secret` as the key.  This verifies that the iframe is being\n loaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user.  In production, you\n should validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the\n[official site](http://jwt.io)), and only use the parameters extracted from the\nJWT.  Using Python and Django, this might look like:\n\n    import jwt\n\n    CLIENT_SECRET = <client_secret>\n    MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS = 60\n\n    def validate_parameters(request):\n        token = request.GET['jwt']\n\n        return jwt.decode(token, CLIENT_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS)\n\nModern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between\nyour application and drchrono's page through the iframe.  Therefore, interaction\nmust happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.\n\n# Versions and deprecation\n\n## Stability Policy\n\nChanges to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing\nendpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n \nThe drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:\n\n * **Active:** This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by\nour API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do\nnot break backwards compatibility.\n\n* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been\nsurpassed by our active API version. An API version remains in this state for one year,\nafter which time it falls to the not supported state. A deprecated API version is passively supported;\nwhile it won't be removed until becoming unsupported, it may not receive new features but will likely\nbe subject to security updates and performance improvements.\n \n* **Unsupported:** An API version in the not supported state may be deactivated at any\ntime. An application using an unsupported API version should migrate to an active API version.\n\n## Version Map\n| Version Name | Previous Name | Start Date | Deprecation Date |\n|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------|\n | v2           | v2015_08      | 08/2015    | TBA              |\n| v3           | v2016_06      | 06/2016    |                  |\n| v4           | N/A           | 09/2018    |                  |\n\nIf you are looking for documentation for an older version\n\n- [V4(Hunt Valley)](/api-docs-old/v4/documentation) (old V4 documentation)\n- [V3(Sunnyvale)](/api-docs-old/v3/documentation)\n- [V2(Mountain View)](/api-docs-old/v2/documentation)\n\n# Changelog\n\nHere's changelog for different versions\n\n- [Current Changelog](https://headwayapp.co/drchrono-changelog)\n - [V4 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v4/changelog)\n- [V3 Changelog](/api-docs-old/v3/changelog)\n\n",
