Domain Authentication signals trustworthiness to email inbox providers and your recipients by approving SendGrid to send email on behalf of your domain. For more information, see [**How to Set Up Domain Authentication**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).\n\nEach user may have a maximum of 3,000 authenticated domains and 3,000 link brandings. This limit is at the user level, meaning each Subuser belonging to a parent account may have its own 3,000 authenticated domains and 3,000 link brandings.",
