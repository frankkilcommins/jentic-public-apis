  "description": "IP Twilio SendGrid IP Access Management API allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the SendGrid application user interface or the API.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can allow.\n\nIt is possible to remove your own IP address from your list of allowed addresses, thus blocking your own access to your account. While we are able to restore your access, we do require thorough proof of your identify and ownership of your account. We take the security of your account very seriously and wish to prevent any 'bad actors' from maliciously gaining access to your account. Your current IP is clearly displayed to help prevent you from accidentally removing it from the allowed addresses.\n\nSee [**IP Access Management**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/ip-access-management) for more information.",
