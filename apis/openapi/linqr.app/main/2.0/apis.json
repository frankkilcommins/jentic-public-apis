  "description": "This is LinQR QR Code API documentation. This API allows you to generate custom, visually attractive QR Codes. The cloud infrastructure guarantees high availability and autoscalability of the service. You can generate hundreds of thousands of images this way and use them however you like.\n\nWe realize that your API use case may require custom solutions, and perhaps we lack functionality that is very important to you. In that case feel free to write an email to our support and tell us about it. We have repeatedly added new functions of our service directly after the requests of our users.\n\n**General remarks:**\n - maximum request size is fixed at 32MB.\n - request timeout is fixed at 180 seconds.\n\n # Authentication\n\nThe LinQR offers two authentication schemes for accessing API. The first method is based on the OAuth2.0 protocol, where clients obtain client credentials for secure and direct access. Alternatively, you can authenticate through RapidAPI, a proxy service that handles authentication on behalf of the client. RapidAPI simplifies the process by acting as an intermediary between the client and LinQR's API.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and efficiency, it is recommended to use the preferred OAuth2.0 scheme. This method provides secure and direct access to LinQR's API resources. While the alternative authentication scheme through RapidAPI is available, it may introduce additional latency or dependencies that could impact the overall speed and responsiveness of your API requests. Therefore, to maximize speed and reliability, it is advisable to utilize the direct authentication method provided by LinQR.\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->",
