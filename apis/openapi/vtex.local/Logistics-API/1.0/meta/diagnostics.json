      "description_suggestion": "Retrieves pickup points in paginated format for efficient handling of large datasets. Supports pagination parameters (page number, page size) and optional filtering. Returns paginated results with pickup point objects containing location details, operating hours, and service capabilities. Limited to 100 pages maximum. Use this endpoint when retrieving more than 1,000 pickup points or when pagination is required.",
      "reasoning": "Summary is appropriate for a paginated list operation. Description lacks information about pagination parameters (page, size), filtering options, and response structure. Added clarity about supported parameters, response format, and the use case distinction from the non-paginated endpoint to help AI agents understand how to construct requests and handle paginated responses.",
