For more details: http://www.waterlinked.com\n\nRecommended approach for connecting to a Underwater GPS via the API is:\n- If \"GET /api/\" times out, the Underwater GPS is not running (on this IP address)\n- If \"GET /api/\" responds with 200 OK check that the api version returrned (eg \"v1\") is supported by the client (eg: also supports \"v1\").\n- If the api version returned does not match what the client supports: give an error to the user and recommend upgrading. (Eg: response is \"v2\" while client only supports \"v1\")\n- If \"GET /api/\" responds with 301 Moved permanently. \"GET /api/v1/version\" to check if the kit has a version earlier than 1.5.\n- \"GET /api/v1/version\" will always respond with 200 OK on Underwater GPS earlier than 1.5 release.\n\nConfiguration API is is not considered stable and will potentially be changed",
