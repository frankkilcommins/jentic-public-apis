  "description": "You can use the [Disputes API](https://docs.adyen.com/risk-management/disputes-api) to automate the dispute handling process so that you can respond to disputes and chargebacks as soon as they are initiated. The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n \n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n ...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n \n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",
