  "description": "The BIN Lookup API provides endpoints for retrieving information, such as cost estimates, and 3D Secure supported version based on a given BIN.\n \n## Authentication\nYou need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) to authenticate to the API.\n\nIf using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\n\n## Versioning\nThe BinLookup API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v50/get3dsAvailability\n ```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v50/get3dsAvailability\n ```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",
